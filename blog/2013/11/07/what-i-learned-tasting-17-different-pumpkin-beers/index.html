        What I Learned Tasting 17 Different Pumpkin Beers

<div class="entry-content clearfix"><p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/2013/11/what-i-learned-tasting-pumpkin-beers/carnage.jpg" width="300"> I initially embarked on this journey in a effort to finally know, instead of guessing from year to year, which pumpkin beer I enjoyed the most. All I would need to do is taste a bunch of different pumpkin beers and see which I liked best. Easy, right? I was woefully unprepared for what lay ahead.</p>

<p>While conducting a beer tasting of this scale is not difficult, it is not entirely straightforward either. However, there are some things you can do to ensure a smooth, easy experience. Below are the five things I know now that I wish I had known at the start. Hopefully this will help someone learn from my mistakes and inspire you to conduct your own tasting experiments.</p>

<ol>
<li>Plan Ahead</li>
<li>Beware Palate Fatigue</li>
<li>Invite Everyone!</li>
<li>Define Ranking Criteria</li>
<li>Negative Feedback is Guaranteed</li>
</ol>


<p><span class="label label-primary">Bonus</span> 7 Pumpkin Beers You Should Try Next Year</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>1. Plan Ahead</h3>

<p>First, make a wish list of the beers you would like to try and then find out which ones you can purchase locally. Due to federal regulations, stores are at the mercy of their distributor when it comes to what they can stock. Just because a store orders a certain beer does not mean it will be delivered (I ran into this several times). Different distributors carry different beers so find a few favorite stores in as many different distribution areas as possible.</p>

<p>Second, buy your beers as soon as possible and have enough for all your tastings (perhaps some extras as well). Seasonal beers can be difficult to find and are often short-lived. I was unable to taste Lakefront&rsquo;s pumpkin beer in Round 4 because I did not buy it when I had the chance. Do not make the same mistake.</p>

<h3>2. Beware Palate Fatigue</h3>

<p>While especially important with strong spiced beers, how fatiguing the style you are tasting should affect how many beers you taste at a time. Five pumpkin beers in one sitting was a bit much while attempting to be objective. I would have reduced the number we tasted in a round to three, at most four, per tasting to achieve cleaner results. Now that you know how many beers you will have available and how many you can taste at a time, you can start planning your tastings accordingly. Putting it all together at the last minute week after week is exhausting.</p>

<h3>3. <a href="http://youtu.be/MrTsuvykUZk">Invite Everyone!</a></h3>

<p>From a statistical standpoint, the larger the sample size the more closer your results will reflect the population. While this is great, for me the true value of doing tastings with other people comes from the experience itself. I quite enjoy my food and beer and I am always excited to share it with others. A wider range of values also provides a better analysis of the beer and others can help identify flavors/smells you may have difficulty describing. I continue to be amazed at the differing experiences people have when tasting the same beer. I do not regret spending the time with The Wife, but I do wish I could have shared the experience with others. In the future, I will be inviting people to participate in all rounds of the showdown.</p>

<h3>4. Define Ranking Criteria</h3>

<p>To be perfectly honest, our rankings were terribly subjective. I did not fully realize this until I was called out on my rating of Blue Moon being higher than Schlafly. This was a surprise to me as Schlafly&rsquo;s Pumpkin Ale is in the top ten pumpkin beers on <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/style/72">Beer Advocate</a>. So why had we rated Blue Moon higher? These beers were tasted at different times against different sets of beers. At first, I did not have an answer because we had never defined a rating criteria. After thinking about it a while, it turns out we had been rating beers based on how drinkable a beer was. In Schlafly&rsquo;s case, the richness of the pumpkin flavors lowered the rating.</p>

<p>Was this a good call? Probably not. Not having a defined tasting criteria leads to inconsistent rankings when tasting beers in sets at different times. Having a defined criteria will help explain why you ranked a beer as you did. This situation could have been avoided by having a consistent criteria which should lead to less subjective results. The injustice stuck with me so much that I chose Schlafly as our wild card beer for the finals. I am glad I did because Schlafly placed a solid second place in the showdown finals. Next time I will create a grading sheet ahead of time, most likely based off of the BJCP guidelines. <a href="http://obedientingredients.wordpress.com/2013/09/26/blind-pumpkin-beer-tasting/">Here is an example of a well-defined tasting.</a></p>

<h3>5. Negative Feedback is Guaranteed</h3>

<p>While I had lots of great feedback and recommendations from people who followed the showdown, I was surprised at the amount of negativity generated by the list of beers chosen. The torches and pitchforks came out over not including certain beers and the validity of the entire experiment questioned. For this reason I have created the following disclaimer which I will be adding to future showdown finals to help clear things up:</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
    <h4>Disclaimer</h4>
    <p>This list is not meant to be exhaustive or comprehensive. Limited by our distributor, these were all the beers available to me at the time of the tasting. If you do not see your favorite on the list, be assured I did not leave it off intentionally.</p>
    <p>Nor should this list be considered the definitive rating of these beers. Instead, my purpose is to inspire you to try something new or perhaps help you avoid beers you may not enjoy. If you do not agree with our opinions, great! Tell me <em>why</em> and what you prefer instead.  Or better yet, organize your own tasting and send me the results. I would love to have your perspective and I am always looking for new beers to try.</p>
</div>


<p>I don&rsquo;t expect all feedback to be sunshine and rainbows, but hopefully this will prevent any future misunderstandings in my process of selecting beers for the showdown.</p>
