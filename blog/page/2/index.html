  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>My favorite season of the year is almost upon us. Cooler weather, changing colors, all the best holidays, and of course, seasonal beer. One of the most iconic Autumn styles is the pumpkin beer. While pumpkin beers were produced in the early days of the American colonies, they were different from the pumpkin beers we know today.  Colonists used pumpkin and squash as the fermenting medium, since malted barley was scarce.  Once malt became more readily available, it replaced these alternatives to grain. In the 1990&rsquo;s, American craft brewers reintroduced the style to the delight of pumpkin beer drinkers.

Five pumpkin beers face off in a head-to-head challenge of seasonal carnage. Which brewery&rsquo;s Fall creation will emerge victorious? Let&rsquo;s find out.</p>

Terra Incognita is a blend of three different aging processes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Terra Incognita aged in Templeton Rye barrels (30%)</li>
<li>Terra Incognita aged in a 2,000-gallon foudre (45%)</li>
<li>Fresh Terra Incognita dry-hopped with East Kent Golding (25%)</li>
</ul>


<p>This blending creates a beer aimed at showcasing some predominant oak characteristics with a subtle hint of earthy hops and which celebrates the unique terroir of the two brewery locations. Then just prior to bottling a dose of the wild yeast Brettanomyces is added and the beer is aged for over three months.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>While this actually happened during our Brooklyn Brewery visit, the experience was so incredible it deserved its own post.</p>

<p>I had been wearing my Boulevard Brewery hat all over NYC without a second thought. The Wife and I were sitting at a table in the Brooklyn Brewery tap room enjoying our beer when I noticed the woman across from us looking at me oddly. Full disclosure, I often deserve being looked at oddly but this was not one of those times. Then to my surprise, this happened:</p>

<blockquote><p>Woman: &#8220;Boulevard Brewing, as in Kansas City?&#8221;<br/>Me: &#8220;Yes. We&#8217;re actually here visiting from Kansas City.&#8221;<br/>Woman: &#8220;My husband and I live in Lawrence, Kansas and are in New York to visit breweries.&#8221;<br/>Me: <em>Jaw Drops</em></p></blockquote>


<p>In one of the largest cities in the world, two couples who live within 50 miles of one another just happen to sit across from each other at the same table. Now that&rsquo;s the power of beer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>The first I&rsquo;d heard about Brooklyn Brewery was from an article in a BYO issue. To be honest, I don&rsquo;t remember much from the article besides the fact they were an older brewery which I wanted to visit. I should probably go back and read that article. Anyway, since I was already in New York City it was a perfect opportunity for a visit. Let me tell you, I&rsquo;m glad that I did.</p>

<p>Brooklyn has a distinctly different feel than Manhattan island. When you emerge from the subway, you&rsquo;re immediately surrounded with by jobs, homes, and real people (not tourists). While I only experienced a few blocks of Brooklyn, it was enough to make an impression.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Held in Washington D.C. for the last five years, <a href="http://www.savorcraftbeer.com/">SAVOR</a> took place this year at the Altman Building and adjoining Metropolitan Pavilion in Manhattan, New York. Attendees enjoy a reception-style sampling of sweet and savoury appetizers and craft beers from over seventy small and independent craft breweries.</p>

<p>If I had to describe my SAVOR experience in one word it would be <em>overwhelming</em>. I say this in the best possible way but I was entirely unprepared for the event. Not that I did not plan ahead (I remembered to wear pants and everything!) and this wasn&rsquo;t the first beer/wine tasting events I had attended. Maybe it was just the product of a Midwesterner&rsquo;s first time in the Big Apple but this event was broad in a scope to a degree I had not imagined.</p>

<p>SAVOR offers the opportunity to participate in directed tasting salons featuring stars from the craft beer and food scene. Very few events offer the opportunity to have a one-on-one conversation with the rock stars of the craft beer world. My frantic Ticketmaster antics during the pre-sale managed to secure myself tickets to one of the salon&rsquo;s:</p>

<p><strong>Apocalypse Now and Again (and Again)</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>If the world were coming to end, what beer would you brew? In 2012, <a href="http://www.elysianbrewing.com">Elysian Brewing Company</a> answered that question with their 12 Beers of the Apocalypse series. While the world may not have come to an end, the Apocalypse series did, leaving behind a dozen unique beers, each brewed with unusual ingredients. Join Elysian founder Dick Cantwell as he shares samples of four beers from the series and talks about the trials and tribulations of the project.</p></blockquote>

<p>Only a small increase in the ticket price, the private tasting was money well spent. If the ticket price weren&rsquo;t so steep I would probably go both days just to have the opportunity to attend two salons. Read on for a look into our SAVOR experience.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Today I am launching the Beer Kingdom, a group of visualizations to help us better understand the various beer styles. The first of these visualizations is the <a href="/beer-kingdom/bjcp-style-tree/">BJCP Style Tree</a>. Future visualizations will show the relationship between the different beer styles.</p>

<p>While I frequently find myself visiting the BJCP website for style information, I also frequently find myself wishing there was a better way to navigate the style data. The BJCP website is full of valuable information but the user interface is stuck in the 1990s. For this reason I have designed the BJCP Style Tree as a smoother, graphical way to access the style information. All the style information can be found here but in a way which takes advantage of today&rsquo;s web technology.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/2013/04/samuel-adams-tasman-red/outside.jpg" width="300"> This wily red IPA gets its character from the Tasmanian hops that are full of grapefruit, pine, and earthy notes creating a bold flavor that threads throughout the taste.  The hops are balanced by a core of roasty malts that give this brew body and richness with hints of toffee.  This flavorful brew is rounded and smooth with a dry and citrusy hop finish.</p>
