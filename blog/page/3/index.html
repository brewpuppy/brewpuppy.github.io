  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>I finally received my Raspberry Pi Model B today and I must say it was an ordeal. After being on backorder for over a month, last week I began to see <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57577289-93/raspberry-pi-$25-model-sells-out-soon-after-u.s-debut/">news articles</a> discussing none other than Allied Electronics selling out of the Raspberry Pi in the United States. Surely if they had enough Raspberry Pis to sell to <em>new</em> customers there would enough inventory to fill backorders, right? So I emailed my account manager and was informed my order had not yet been filled. Huh, that&rsquo;s odd. Maybe they are just backed up with all the business and my order is about to be filled? Nope. I receive the same &ldquo;as soon as we get them in from the supplier but we don&rsquo;t know when that will be&rdquo; response to my query on a possible fill date. Meanwhile, over at <a href="http://www.newark.com/">Newark</a> I&rsquo;ve watched thousands of Raspberry Pis ship out each week.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/2013/04/raspberry-pi-received/logo.jpg" width="350"></p>

<p>Without any sort of time frame and another vendor able to ship today, I could no longer able to justify waiting and decided to cancel my order. Suddenly, upon request to have my order cancelled, I am told my order is being picked in the warehouse. Suspicious coincidence? Maybe, but I was willing to keep my order once I had seen the order was shipped. While I don&rsquo;t like to look a gift horse in the mouth, going forward I will be taking my business to Newark. I would like to point out that my account manager was very helpful, quick to respond to my queries, and spent quite a bit of time communicating with someone whose order was small. All of this despite being at the mercy of whoever was running the warehouse. Enough with that drama already; let&rsquo;s see what is in the box.</p>

My hope is to use the Raspberry Pi as the controller for a fermentation chamber, and then later as the master to mutliple slave fermentation chambers. But I&rsquo;m getting ahead of myself; I still have no idea when this will ship. Let the waiting begin!</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>The Raccoon River Brewery is located in downtown Des Moines, a bit difficult to find but that could have been the snow and just generally not knowing where I was in a new city. We also have a hard time not calling it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon_City">Raccoon City</a> Brewery which made for some interesting conversations.</p>

<p>A large upscale restaurant with a pub feel, Raccoon River has a second level which looks down onto the first. A two-story tower of brewing equipment becomes a centerpiece for both levels of the restaurant. The top level looks down on the bottom and has pool tables. We didn&rsquo;t see much else because we never went up. Next time I&rsquo;m make sure to get a real tour.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/2013/02/olde-main-brewing-company/sign.jpg" width="300"> Old Maine Brewery is located in the heart of downtown Ames&#8217; quaint Main Street district. Enter the restaurant and brewpub and you are immediately drawn in by the historic Main Street atmosphere and friendly brewpub feel. An abundance of wood gives the interior a warm, old-fashioned feeling making you right at home.</p>

<p>We ordered a plate of cheese fries at the time of the beer tasting so we would be able to continue driving afterwards. The cheese fries were about what you would expect at a bowling alley and easily something I could have made at home (frozen French fries + American cheese). Our waitress was very nice and quite helpful even though she was obviously busy preparing for the evening crowd. For this reason we forgive her for suggesting the cheese fries appetizer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/2013/02/summit-brewing-company/sign-outside.jpg" width="300">Every Friday night, Summit invites a food truck and has a special beer on tap in addition to their full line-up of beers. The week we were there it was <a href="http://ramacsammys.com/">R.A. Mac Sammy&rsquo;s</a> which serves awesome mac-n-cheese dishes. Unfortunately I forgot my notebook in the rush to get to the brewery before the food truck left, so I don&rsquo;t have notes on the beer or any foods thoughts. What I can tell you is that I tried all of the available beers and enjoyed each one of them. Also, sauerkraut on mac-n-cheese is delicious (trust me on this one).</p>

<p>The tap room features a large area open area with many tables and benches. Music plays but not loud enough to be disruptive. You buy tokens from the cashier which are used to purchase beer from the bartender. I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of the system (the cashier is about ten feet from the bartender) but I can see how it would help keep people flowing when busy. There is also a gift shop right off the tap room where we picked up some <a href="http://store.summitbrewing.com/drinklocaltee.aspx">Summit swag</a>. Not shown in the pictures below are the double set of German copper brew kettles which are behind the large glass tap room wall (it was too dark to take better pictures with our old camera).</p>

<p>I would probably end up coming to Summit every Friday if it were not several states away. The good beer coupled with new and different foods would be too much to resist. Hopefully I will have time to schedule a tour the next time I am in the area.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/2013/02/court-avenue-brewing-company/pub-sign.jpg" width="300"> I had originally planned on my first stop through Des Moines to be the Raccoon River brewery, however we wandered the downtown streets without a map and eventually became lost. Luckily, we ended up going in the direction of the Court Avenue brewery which had a conveniently large sign to direct you out of the cold and into a warm restaurant. Fate had spoken, so we switched our agenda and made Court Avenue our first brewery stop of the trip.</p>

<p>I ordered the BBQ Pork sandwich which was shredded pork in BlackHawk Stout BBQ sauce on Texas toast and topped with coleslaw and a side of potato salad. The Wife ordered the BBQ Chicken pizza which has grilled chicken, red onion, fresh cilantro &amp; BlackHawk Stout BBQ sauce, with cheddar jack &amp; mozzarella cheese. For dessert we shared a huge piece of bread pudding. Needless to say we were stuffed by the end of the meal. All-in-all the food was absolutely amazing; the pictures cannot do them justice (especially with our old camera). In fact, I may have enjoyed the food more than the beer (gasp!).</p>

<p>A good portion of the brewing equipment (kettles, fermenters, etc.) are behind glass in the dining room which makes for an interesting centerpiece during the dining experience. These are not only for show either, because we watched a brewer actively brewing something during our visit. He even stopped by our table and asked us how we were enjoying the beer when he saw me taking notes.</p>

<p>I was able to try most of the flagship beers as well as a few guest beers from <a href="http://21st-amendment.com/">21st Amendment</a>, a seasonal, and the special reserve stock in their standard sampler flight. My thoughts on the flagship beers below.</p>
