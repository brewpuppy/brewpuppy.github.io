    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While this actually happened during our Brooklyn Brewery visit, the experience was so incredible it deserved its own post.</p>

<p>I had been wearing my Boulevard Brewery hat all over NYC without a second thought. The Wife and I were sitting at a table in the Brooklyn Brewery tap room enjoying our beer when I noticed the woman across from us looking at me oddly. Full disclosure, I often deserve being looked at oddly but this was not one of those times. Then to my surprise, this happened:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Woman: &ldquo;Boulevard Brewing, as in Kansas City?&rdquo;<br/>Me: &ldquo;Yes. We&rsquo;re actually here visiting from Kansas City.&rdquo;<br/>Woman: &ldquo;My husband and I live in Lawrence, Kansas and are in New York to visit breweries.&rdquo;<br/>Me: <em>Jaw Drops</em></p></blockquote></p>

<p>In one of the largest cities in the world, two couples who live within 50 miles of one another just happen to sit across from each other at the same table. Now that&rsquo;s the power of beer.</p>
