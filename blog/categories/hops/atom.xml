    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I knew I wanted to try growing hops this year, but I did not know much else and my gardening experience was limited. At the very least I needed to decide which varieties I would attempt, but how to decide which to buy? After shopping around I was paralysed with all my different choices. Growing hops would be a large time and space commitment for me and I didn&rsquo;t want to make a choice I would regret later.</p>

<p>The following is the process I went through to decide which hop varieties I would grow. I don&rsquo;t claim this to be the best way to decide which hops to grow, but it helped me at least <em>feel</em> like I was making an informed decision. Hopefully someone else can use this information to help them as well.</p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Tables of data ahead.</p>

<h3>Step One: Identify Priorities</h3>

<p>My first step was to identify my priorities for choosing a hop. These priorities would determine how to use the data collected in Step Two.</p>

<ol>
<li>Aroma &ndash; Without knowing the alpha acids of the hops I would be growing, I wanted to stick with aroma hops to maintain bitterness consistency.</li>
<li>Versatility &ndash; I only have enough room to grow a few varieties so I wanted to be able to use what I grow in as many different recipes as possible.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Step Two: Gather Data</h3>

<p>After my priorities had been determined, I needed a way to objectively rate hop varieties in a way which would relate to back my priorities. To do this I recorded the hop usage for each recipe style in <em>Brewing Classic Styles</em> by Jamil Zainasheff and John Palmer. This would give me a decent cross-section across all beer styles. There would be some bias from the authors&rsquo;s personal preferences but I was willing to accept that for this decision.</p>

<p>Legend:</p>

<ul>
<li>Count: Number of recipes where this hop was used.</li>
<li>Ounces: Total number of ounces used across all recipes.</li>
<li>Average: Average ounces of hops used per recipe.</li>
<li>Hop Additions: Number of additions for each time period during the boil across all recipes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step Three: Analysis</h3>

<p>My top priority was only selecting an aroma hop, so my first step was to eliminate all non-aroma varieties. The first step in identifying aroma hops was to go through <em>For the Love of Hops</em> by Stan Hieronymus and find any varieties in either the Bittering or Proprietary categories.</p>

<p>First, I eliminated all varieties in the Proprietary category. If the variety cannot be purchased it should not be considered. Second, I eliminated all varieties with an aroma percentage (number of aroma additions / total number of additions) less than 0.5 <em>and</em> which did not have an above average number (4.238095238) of aroma hop additions.</p>

<p>The first condition identifies varieties used primarily as a bittering addition. Bitterness additions are defined as any addition 90-30 minutes in the boil. Aroma additions are defined as any addition 29-0 minutes in the boil as well as any addition after the boil. This calculation matched up well against the Stan Hieronymus&rsquo;s Bittering category. The second condition ensured that despite being used primary for bittering, if the variety had an above average number of aroma additions it should be included for consideration.</p>

<p>After applying these two conditions, the original list has been narrowed down (see below) to include only aroma hops which can be purchased commercially.</p>

<p>My secondary priority was only selecting hops which can be used in a variety of recipes; a simple descending sort was all that was needed here. Three hop varieties had above average recipe counts: Kent Goldings, Hallertau, and Centennial.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>After reviewing the data, the choice was clear as to which hops I should plant. This year I ordered Centennial and Golding varieties. I plan on researching an American strain such as Mt. Hood or Liberty as a substitute for Hallertau next year. I&rsquo;m not yet confident with my gardening abilities and would like to keep to varieties suitable for growing in the Midwest. Perhaps if I am successful this year I&rsquo;ll go all in and order the Hallertau strain next year.</p>

    <updated>2013-12-22T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://brewpuppy.github.io/blog/2013/12/22/glacier-hops</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year I purchased Glacier hop pellets in bulk for the significant cost difference. I vacuum-sealed them into 1.0/1.5/2.0 oz portions, which I&rsquo;ve done before with Centennial and Cascade hops with good results. Not being familiar with the Glacier variety and wanting to clear up some freezer space, I used them in my IPA test recipe:</p>

<ul>
<li>Malts:

<ul>
<li>7.0 lb Pale LME</li>
<li>1.0 lb Maris Otter Malt</li>
<li>1.0 lb Crystal 20</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hops:

<ul>
<li>90 min: 0.5 oz (enough to hit 35 IBU)</li>
<li>30 min: 1.5 oz</li>
<li>00 min: 2.0 oz</li>
<li>Dry: 2.0 oz</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Yeast: US-05 @ 67F</li>
</ul>


<p>While the bitterness was as expected, the hop flavor and aroma were anything but; the reaction from everyone, myself included, when tasting the beer was &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I expected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aroma tingles the nose, almost like mint, and is not as potent as expected with the amount of dry hopping. Flavor is a cool, clean citrus but subdued to the point you would not know it was dry hopped and far less than the aroma implies. A very clean bitterness; right on the money.</p>

<p>The beer does not taste bad (The Wife rather likes subdued hop flavors), just unexpected from this level of hopping. The aroma is almost entirely disconnected from the amount of hop flavors present. The end result is an IPA unlike anything I&rsquo;ve tasted prior. Definitely something to keep in mind the next time I use Glacier hops.</p>
