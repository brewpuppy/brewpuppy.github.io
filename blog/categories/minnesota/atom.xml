    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/2013/02/summit-brewing-company/sign-outside.jpg" width="300">Every Friday night, Summit invites a food truck and has a special beer on tap in addition to their full line-up of beers. The week we were there it was <a href="http://ramacsammys.com/">R.A. Mac Sammy&rsquo;s</a> which serves awesome mac-n-cheese dishes. Unfortunately I forgot my notebook in the rush to get to the brewery before the food truck left, so I don&rsquo;t have notes on the beer or any foods thoughts. What I can tell you is that I tried all of the available beers and enjoyed each one of them. Also, sauerkraut on mac-n-cheese is delicious (trust me on this one).</p>

<p>The tap room features a large area open area with many tables and benches. Music plays but not loud enough to be disruptive. You buy tokens from the cashier which are used to purchase beer from the bartender. I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of the system (the cashier is about ten feet from the bartender) but I can see how it would help keep people flowing when busy. There is also a gift shop right off the tap room where we picked up some <a href="http://store.summitbrewing.com/drinklocaltee.aspx">Summit swag</a>. Not shown in the pictures below are the double set of German copper brew kettles which are behind the large glass tap room wall (it was too dark to take better pictures with our old camera).</p>
