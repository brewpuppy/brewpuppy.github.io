    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I finally received my Raspberry Pi Model B today and I must say it was an ordeal. After being on backorder for over a month, last week I began to see <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57577289-93/raspberry-pi-$25-model-sells-out-soon-after-u.s-debut/">news articles</a> discussing none other than Allied Electronics selling out of the Raspberry Pi in the United States. Surely if they had enough Raspberry Pis to sell to <em>new</em> customers there would enough inventory to fill backorders, right? So I emailed my account manager and was informed my order had not yet been filled. Huh, that&rsquo;s odd. Maybe they are just backed up with all the business and my order is about to be filled? Nope. I receive the same &ldquo;as soon as we get them in from the supplier but we don&rsquo;t know when that will be&rdquo; response to my query on a possible fill date. Meanwhile, over at <a href="http://www.newark.com/">Newark</a> I&rsquo;ve watched thousands of Raspberry Pis ship out each week.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/2013/04/raspberry-pi-received/logo.jpg" width="350"></p>

<p>Without any sort of time frame and another vendor able to ship today, I could no longer able to justify waiting and decided to cancel my order. Suddenly, upon request to have my order cancelled, I am told my order is being picked in the warehouse. Suspicious coincidence? Maybe, but I was willing to keep my order once I had seen the order was shipped. While I don&rsquo;t like to look a gift horse in the mouth, going forward I will be taking my business to Newark. I would like to point out that my account manager was very helpful, quick to respond to my queries, and spent quite a bit of time communicating with someone whose order was small. All of this despite being at the mercy of whoever was running the warehouse. Enough with that drama already; let&rsquo;s see what is in the box.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I took the plunge and ordered a <a href="http://www.alliedelec.com/search/productdetail.aspx?SKU=70229569">Raspberry Pi (Model B)</a> onlong with an <a href="http://www.alliedelec.com/search/productdetail.aspx?SKU=70241571">accessory kit</a> to get me started. My hope is to use the Raspberry Pi as the controller for a fermentation chamber, and then later as the master to mutliple slave fermentation chambers. But I&rsquo;m getting ahead of myself; I still have no idea when this will ship. Let the waiting begin!</p>
