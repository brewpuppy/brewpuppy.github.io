    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Right now I am supposed to be finishing the tasting notes of Grainstorm, Boulevard&rsquo;s latest beer in the Smokestack series. My tasting notes are sitting right next to my keyboard and the text file with my initial notes is still open. This situation has not changed in at least an hour. I didn&rsquo;t realize how much I was putting this write-up off until I caught myself browsing through pictures of Husky puppies; I just can&rsquo;t bring myself to finish it.</p>

<p>I enjoy tasting new beers, but for some reason the tasting write-up process has become tedious. While I <em>think</em> my palate is experienced, I believe it lacks the training needed to produce quality tasting notes. For these reasons I have decided to take a break. Unless I have the opportunity to taste a rare beer (e.g. Savor collaboration beers) or gather the needed energy to organize another Showdown, tastings posts will stop. Perhaps when I have passed the Cicerone test I&rsquo;ll continue regular write-ups.</p>

<p>Going forward I will concentrate on topics more focused on beer-related technology and data. Long story short: Posts will continue but the topics will change, hopefully for the better. Cheers!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/2014/02/chocolate-ale/table-inside.jpg" width="200" title="&ldquo;On the Bier Garden&rdquo; &ldquo;Picture of beer in glass inside with terribly lighting&rdquo;" > A collaboration between <a href="http://www.elbowchocolates.com/">Christopher Elbow</a> and Boulevard brewmaster Steven Pauwels, Chocolate Ale harmonizes the chocolate and malt, each supporting and enhancing, but not overwhelming, the other. Elbow recommended a rare variety of chocolate from the Dominican Republic, prized for its robust flavor and aroma. More than a mere flavoring, the crushed, roasted beans were incorporated into the brewing process itself.</p>

<p>Chocolate Ale is full of surprises, beginning with a glowing amber hue. The aroma is given over to earthy, fruity cocoa, with just a hint of hops. Smooth layers of dark chocolate intertwine with threads of caramel, vanilla, and nutty malt as the flavor warms and rounds to a bitter-sweet finish.</p>

<h3>What I Expected</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style23.php">Speciality Beer (23)</a>, base style unknown but my guess is a <a href="http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style10.php#1c">American Brown Ale (10C)</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Appearance &ndash; Clear, dark amber color. Moderate, light tan head with decent retention from the wheat.</li>
<li>Aroma &ndash; Fruit notes mixed with a rich cocoa, with just a hint of green/minty hop aroma. The character of the cacao nibs should be evident.</li>
<li>Flavor &ndash; High caramel, vanilla, and nutty malt flavors. Medium bitter finish from the chocolate. Slightly sweet from the caramel malts. Medium body finishing with some alcohol warmth. The distinctive flavor character associated from the cacao nibs should be noticeable.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Tasting Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Appearance &ndash; Copper color with medium-high clarity. The head is an ivory with low retention, possibly from being on draft. The CO2 bubbles rising from the sides of the glass from the higher level makes the beer quite the looker.</li>
<li>Aroma &ndash; Exactly how a chocolate ale should smell. The cocoa is the dominant aroma with sweet caramel malt coming in a distant second. Possibly some fruit mixed in there but the cocoa has beaten the other aromas into submission.</li>
<li>Flavor &ndash; Heavy malt, with grainy, caramel, and cocoa dominating. Reminds me of the flavors of a Tootsie Roll but with a rich vanilla backbone. The cacao gives the beer a different sort of bitterness which doesn&rsquo;t linger.</li>
<li>Mouthfeel &ndash; Dry finish which evaporates off the tongue. Light bodied and effervescent with lingering alcohol warmth.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Conclusion: Excellent (43 / 50)</h3>

<p><strong>Guest Tasters:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The Wife: Outstanding (47 / 50)</li>
</ul>


<h4>Appearance: 2 / 3</h4>

<p>The practically non-existent head cost the beer one point.</p>

<ul>
<li>Second Opinion &ndash; The Wife: 2 / 3

<ul>
<li>Head: Low Size and Retention, Cream Color</li>
<li>Medium Clarity</li>
<li>Amber/Brown Color</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Aroma: 8 / 12</h4>

<p>I did not experience any earthy or hop aromas which were not overpowered by the cacao. There was perhaps a touch of fruitiness, but I could have been making that up in my head it was so slight. While I quite enjoyed the aroma, I had to dock the beer for not being as described.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Wife: 11 / 12

<ul>
<li>High Sweetness</li>
<li>Caramel malt</li>
<li>Chocolate Cherries</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Flavor: 19 / 20</h4>

<p>I was sceptical of how the dominating cocoa would work out, but the taste is almost exactly what I expected.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Wife: 19 / 20

<ul>
<li>Medium-High Caramel Malt</li>
<li>Medium-High Sweetness, Medium-Low Bitterness</li>
<li>Medium Earthy Hops</li>
<li>Even Balance</li>
<li>Berry and Chocolate flavors (chocolate covered cherries)</li>
<li>Just enough bitterness to cut the sweetness at the end</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Mouthfeel: 5 / 5</h4>

<p>The light body prevents the beer from feeling too heavy from the sweetness and chocolate flavors.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Wife: 5 / 5

<ul>
<li>Medium-High Body</li>
<li>Medium Carbonation</li>
<li>Low-Medium Warmth and Creaminess</li>
<li>Dry Finish</li>
<li>Smooth with slight tingle on the back end with the hop flavor</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Overall Impression: 9 / 10</h4>

<p>Chocolate is usually associated with sweet, which this beer is not. As someone who likes drier beers, this beer makes for the perfect dessert pour. I really want to try making ice cream with this beer.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Wife: 10 / 10

<ul>
<li>I would pay money for this beer; please send me the recipe!</li>
<li>Yes please, chocolate dessert.</li>
</ul>

    <updated>2014-01-07T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://brewpuppy.github.io/blog/2014/01/07/boulevard-rye-on-rye</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/2014/01/rye-on-rye/outside.jpg" width="300" title="&ldquo;Outside Facing North&rdquo; &ldquo;Picture of bottle and beer in glass outside with northern light&rdquo;" > Rye is an assertively flavorful grain more often associated with whiskey than with ales but has largely been eclipsed by corn and barley, the sources of bourbon and scotch. When Boulevard procured seasoned barrels from <a href="http://www.templetonrye.com">Templeton Rye</a>, they chose to brew a rich, tawny rye ale, then mellowed it in the warmth of charred oak rye whiskey casks. Two kinds of malted rye provide spicy sweetness, giving way to notes of caramelized wood and the citrusy tang of Citra and Ahtanum hops before easing into a dry, lingering finish.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>Heads up!</strong> Despite what your bottle label may say, Boulevard Brewer Jeremy Danner has confirmed the hop schedule listed here is correct.</div>

<h3>What I Expected</h3>

<p>What first springs to mind for me is an imperial version of an <a href="http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style06.php#1d">American Rye Beer (6D)</a> but the color is far too dark to be true to the style, not to mention the oak aging. The extra bitterness should balance out the rich malts as long as the spice of the rye is not overpowering.</p>

<ul>
<li>Appearance &ndash; Dark amber more in line with a porter or stout and a nice solid head from the rye.</li>
<li>Aroma &ndash; Oak, caramels, and maybe a touch of citrus or spicy notes.</li>
<li>Flavor &ndash; Sweet caramels from the crystal malts and spiciness from the rye on the front. Warmth from the alcohol. Rich sweetness from the high OG balanced with the bitterness of the hops and rye. I&rsquo;m not sure how the citrus flavors of the hops will fit in but I&rsquo;m hoping they compliment the spiciness of the rye. Oak flavors always take me by surprise in their individual character so while I&rsquo;m expecting the oak flavors to be noticeable, I&rsquo;m not sure exactly how it will come through.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Tasting Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Appearance &ndash; Beautiful amber, mostly clear with just a touch of turbidity. Average dark beige head which dissipates quickly.</li>
<li>Aroma &ndash; Caramel and dark fruit notes with some rye spiciness pulling everything together. Brett sourness comes to mind, possibly from the combination of hops and barrel character.</li>
<li>Flavor &ndash; Simple elegant flavors of rich caramel and a sourness/citrus of hops which I found extremely similar to Brett. Rye was mellow but in a good way. Pleasant warmth of alcohol complements the sweet bourbon twang from the barrels.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Conclusion: Excellent (44 / 50)</h3>

<p><strong>Guest Tasters:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The Wife: Excellent (44 / 50)</li>
</ul>


<h4>Appearance: 2 / 3</h4>

<p>The low head retention cost the beer one point, but was otherwise spot on.</p>

<ul>
<li>Second Opinion &ndash; The Wife: 3 / 3

<ul>
<li>Head: Smooth Texture, Medium Size, Medium-Low Retention, Cream Color</li>
<li>Low Clarity</li>
<li>Amber/Brown Color</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Aroma: 10 / 12</h4>

<p>The caramels and rye spiciness were present, but the sour notes while pleasant, were definitely unexpected.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Wife: 10 / 12

<ul>
<li>High levels of Rich, Caramel, Roasty malt</li>
<li>Medium-Low Hops</li>
<li>Medium-High Sweetness</li>
<li>Slight Brett Smell</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Flavor: 19 / 20</h4>

<p>The complimentary flavors from the malts and the oak tie everything together. Even the citrus sourness which I was so sceptical about fit perfectly into the overall experience.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Wife: 18 / 20

<ul>
<li>Medium-High Hops</li>
<li>Citrusy Hops similar to the tang of Brett</li>
<li>Medium-High Rich, Caramel Malt</li>
<li>Even Balance</li>
<li>Twang of brett or citrus hops</li>
<li>Sweet tingle at the front which mellows with a slight bittering of oak flavor at the end</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Mouthfeel: 4 / 5</h4>

<p>A bit more carbonation than I would prefer in this style; rough on the mouth. However, I let mine breathe for a few minutes and by then it was perfect.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Wife: 4 / 5

<ul>
<li>Sweet Finish</li>
<li>Nice elevated amount of carbonation</li>
<li>Sweet beginning with smooth finish leaves mouth clean</li>
<li>Citrus tingling flavor once the drink is done</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Overall Impression: 9 / 10</h4>

<p>For a &ldquo;harsher&rdquo; rye beer, this is quite drinkable. The balance is spot on for what I enjoy drinking. The oak flavors, especially the bourbon, are great as the beer gets closer to 50F. However, I do not recommend drinking the beer about 55F because the balance goes totally off the wall.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Wife: 9 / 10

<ul>
<li>I would pay money for this beer; please send me the recipe!</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Tasting</h2>

<p>Each participant was asked to rate each beer&rsquo;s Appearance, Smell, and Taste being either a Positive (<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-up text-success"></span>), Neutral, or Negative (<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-down text-danger"></span>) experience. An option to describe the beer in ten words or less was also given. Some people (me!) had difficulty keeping within the ten word limit. After tasting all five beers, the participants were then asked to rank the beers from Best (1) to Worst (5).</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>Sam Adams &ndash; Harvest Pumpkin Ale proved to be the clear winner of the Pumpkin Beer Showdown. Determining the final ranking of the other beers proved to be a bit more difficult. First, for each beer the participants' rank (1-5) were added together and sorted in descending order to determine the Total Rank.</p>

<p><strong>Total Rank</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><span class="badge">19</span> Sam Adams &ndash; Harvest Pumpkin Ale</li>
<li><span class="badge">22</span> Blue Moon &ndash; Harvest Pumpkin Ale</li>
<li><span class="badge">24</span> Schlafly &ndash; Pumpkin Ale</li>
<li><span class="badge">25</span> O'Fallon &ndash; Pumpkin Beer</li>
<li><span class="badge">30</span> Buffalo Bill &ndash; Pumpkin Ale</li>
</ol>


<p>Next, for each positive experience a beer would earn 1 points, for each negative experience a beer would earn -1, and for neutral each neutral experience a beer earned 0 points. The points were added together and sorted in ascending order to determine the Overall Experience.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Experience</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><span class="badge">9</span> Sam Adams &ndash; Harvest Pumpkin Ale</li>
<li><span class="badge">8</span> Schlafly &ndash; Pumpkin Ale</li>
<li><span class="badge">5</span> O'Fallon &ndash; Pumpkin Beer</li>
<li><span class="badge">4</span> Blue Moon &ndash; Harvest Pumpkin Ale</li>
<li><span class="badge">-2</span> Buffalo Bill &ndash; Pumpkin Ale</li>
</ol>


<p>Only by averaging the placement of both the Total Rank and the Overall Experience was I able to determine the Final Ranking.</p>

<p><strong>Final Ranking</strong></p>

<li>Sam Adams &ndash; Harvest Pumpkin Ale</li>
<li>Schlafly &ndash; Pumpkin Ale</li>

Which brewery&rsquo;s late-to-the-party beverage will emerge from Round 4 victorious? Let&rsquo;s find out.</p>

<!-- More -->


<h3><a href="http://rogue.com/beers/chatoe-pumpkin.php">Rogue Farms &ndash; Pumpkin Patch Ale</a></h3>

<p><em><small>The newest addition to the Chatoe Rogue series is Pumpkin Patch Ale, a beer made using fresh pumpkins grown in a patch that borders Rogue&rsquo;s 42 acre hop yard. The pumpkins are picked, loaded into Rogue&rsquo;s farm truck, driven immediately 77 miles to our brewery in Newport, quickly roasted, and pitched into the brew kettle to create a batch of Pumpkin Patch Ale.</small></em></p>

<ul>
<li>14 PLATO</li>
<li>25 Lovibond</li>
<li>75 AA</li>
<li>IBU: 25</li>
<li>Hops: Rogue Micro Hopyard Rebel Hops</li>
<li>Malts: Great Western 2-Row, Carawheat, Weyermann Carafe Malts</li>
<li>Yeast: Pacman Yeast</li>
<li>Special Ingredients: Rogue Farms Pumpkins, Ginger, Cloves, Vanilla bean, Cinnamon, Cardamom, Nutmeg</li>
</ul>


<h4>Brew Puppy: 6 / 10</h4>

<p>Mild nutmeg aroma. Complex flavors of allspice and clove make this beer difficult to decipher but in a good way. However, there is a bit too much astringency on the back-end (maybe the orange peel?) which overstays its welcome. Unfortunately, the extra bitterness at the end kept this from being one of my favorites.</p>

<h4>The Wife: 6 / 10</h4>

<p>Sweet pumpkin nose and a soft spice smell. Smooth malt front flowing easily into spice bitterness. Slight lingering flavor of cinnamon and cloves.</p>

<h3><a href="http://mothersbrewing.com/craft-beers/our-beers/mr-pumpkin/">Mother&rsquo;s &ndash; Mr. Pumpkin</a></h3>

<p><em><small>Our first release from Mother&rsquo;s Cupboard, Mr. Pumpkin is a medium bodied, copper color ale. With just the right blend of 2 Row, Caramel, and Crystal malts, pumpkin and spices, Mother&rsquo;s has created one yummy pint of love. Perfect after dinner in lieu of dessert, or for a night out on the town. Enjoy out doors on cool fall nights, or when slaving over the stove making that holiday dinner for the in-laws. If pie can be for breakfast, well it certainly should work as beer.</small></em></p>

<ul>
<li>ABV: 5.0%</li>
<li>IBU: 10</li>
<li>Color: Copper colored medium to medium-light bodied</li>
<li>Malts: Pale ale, Crystal 35</li>
<li>Hops: Very little hops</li>
<li>Special Ingredients: touch of Roast pumpkin before addition for some carmelization and pie spice in kettle and post fermentation</li>
</ul>


<h4>Brew Puppy: 6 / 10</h4>

<p>Good spice nose of ginger and allspice. Dry finish and pleasant amount of allspice/cinnamon/nutmeg which balances with the malts. Not quite enough body in this beer which lost it points for me.</p>

<h4>The Wife: 6 / 10</h4>

<p>Cinnamon and allspice nose. Lingering cinnamon front-end flavor with mild to modest front-end bitterness and only a small malt flavor.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.woodchuck.com/cider/private-reserves.html">Woodchuck &ndash; Pumpkin Cider</a></h3>

<p><em><small>Every once in a while you know you stumble upon something glorious. That something just so happens to be our Private Reserve Pumpkin. We have combined our signature taste with a refreshing pumpkin finish. Limited to just two and half hours on the production line this is a true connoisseur&rsquo;s cider.</small></em></p>

<h4>Brew Puppy: 2 / 10</h4>

<p>Aroma is an icepick of sweetness straight into the sinuses. The combination of cider and spices tastes like cheap flavoured gum. Couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to take more than one drink so that&rsquo;s all the analysis I&rsquo;ll be providing.</p>

<h4>The Wife: 6 / 10</h4>

<p>Strong apple cider nose. Beautiful dark color. Bubble gum sweet, candy apple flavor with no bitterness. Not sure where the pumpkin flavor fits in.</p>
