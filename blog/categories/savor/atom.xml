    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/2013/08/new-york-limited/outside.jpg" width="300" title="&ldquo;Outside Facing North&rdquo; &ldquo;Picture of bottle and beer in glass outside with northern light&rdquo;" > Brewed and bottled at Brooklyn Brewery, Brookly, NY for SAVOR 2013 NYC this beer is a one-of-a-kind collaboration of Brooklyn Brewery, Brewery Ommegang, and Saranac Brewery. With a focus on local New York ingredients, these brewers combined matled barley, raw wheat, yeast, hops, spices, and ideas grown in New York State to bring you a unique take on wheat beer. This white lager, 100% re-fermented in this bottle, is a collaborative nod to the glorious past and brilliant future of New York State brewing. This special release was presented as an exit gift to SAVOR attendees in a 750 ml corked and caged bottle.</p>

<ul>
<li>Special Ingredients:

<ul>
<li>Coriander</li>
<li>Orange Peel</li>
<li>Lemon Verbena</li>
<li>Wildflower Honey</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Yeast: Lager</li>
<li>ABV: 8.5%</li>
<li>IBU: 16.5 IBU</li>
</ul>

<h3>What I Expected</h3>

<p>Because this beer is unique, some research was involved in order to have any idea what to expect. My primary sources of information were the label on the bottle, the <a href="http://www.savorcraftbeer.com/news/savor-2013-collaboration-beer/">Media Spot</a>, and the <a href="http://www.craftbeerradio.com/cbr-savor/SAVOR.2013.061513.SAVORCollaborationBeer.mp3">SAVOR 2013 Salon recording: SAVOR Collaboration Beer</a>. I also took into consideration the stylistic inspiration for this beer, the Witbier(16A).</p>

<ul>
<li>Aroma &ndash; Moderate sweetness with light, grainy, spicy wheat aromatics, often with a bit of tartness. Dominate coriander with a mix of complex herbal and floral aromas in the background. Moderate zesty, citrusy orangey fruitiness.</li>
<li>Appearance &ndash; Pale straw to light gold in color. Thick light-colored head with good retention from the wheat.</li>
<li>Flavor &ndash; Pleasant sweetness with a honey character and a zesty, orange-citrusy fruitiness. The orange peel and lemon verbena should give this beer a different sort of bitterness alongside the low IBU value to help balance. The honey, coriander, and other herbs should give the beer a somewhat complex floral taste in the absence of a Belgian yeast strain. Coriander levels were higher than expected due to either 1) no masking esters or 2) less vigorous lager fermentation left more particulates to contribute to the flavor. Dry, with a low-amount of residual sugars and clean malt taste makes this beer smooth with the high alcohol levels going largely unnoticed. The use of a lager yeast puts the ingredients used to the main stage when it comes to flavor.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Tasting Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Appearance &ndash; Golden straw colored with a touch of haze but otherwise clear. White, bubbly head can be quite tall and the retention is excellent considering its low density.</li>
<li>Aroma &ndash; Coriander and orange dominates the aroma with a touch of floral notes. Spicy wheat characteristics are there if you&rsquo;re really looking for them. The CO2 tickles my nose.</li>
<li>Mouthfeel &ndash; High carbonation levels makes for a bubbly but unexpectedly creamy texture. I had to pour this beer quickly because after opening the gas release caused the beer to escape the bottle much like a champagne.</li>
<li>Flavor &ndash; Smooth and creamy while still light and refreshing. The orange bitterness lingers a bit on the tongue. Clean lager profile with a solid wheat backdrop for the spices. I think I was picking up on the honey flavors but without knowing the taste profiles of New York honey it is difficult to be certain.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Conclusion: Outstanding (45 / 50)</h3>

<p><strong>Guest Tasters:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The Wife: Outstanding (46 / 50)</li>
</ul>


<h4>Appearance: 3 / 3</h4>

<p>The color and head of this beer was exactly what I expected which deserves a perfect score.</p>

<ul>
<li>Second Opinion &ndash; The Wife: 3 / 3

<ul>
<li>Head: Smooth Texture, Medium-High Size, High Retention, White Color</li>
<li>Low Clarity</li>
<li>Yellow Color</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Aroma: 9 / 12</h4>

<p>Any traces of sweetness or spicy wheat aromatics were masked by the coriander and other spices. Hopefully these will come through more once the beer has had some time to age.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Wife: 10 / 12

<ul>
<li>Grainy, Medium Malt</li>
<li>Citrusy, Earthy, Spicy</li>
<li>Fruity</li>
<li>Soft nose with slight coriander smell</li>
<li>Smooth malt/wheat flavor balances with tingling spice aftertaste which lingers on tongue</li>
<li>Missing: Grainy, Floral</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Flavor: 19 / 20</h4>

<p>The floral flavors were the only missing component here. I suspect the overly dominate coriander covered them up.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Wife: 19 / 20

<ul>
<li>Low Sweetness, Low Bitterness</li>
<li>Medium Hops, Medium Malt</li>
<li>Slight Toasty, Creamy Malt Flavors</li>
<li>Spicy, Citrusy, Herbal</li>
<li>Even Balance</li>
<li>Missing: Floral</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Mouthfeel: 4 / 5</h4>

<p>The high level of carbonation was a bit much but the beer improved after several minutes of degassing.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Wife: 5 / 5

<ul>
<li>Low Body</li>
<li>Medium Carbonation</li>
<li>Dry Finish</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Overall Impression: 10 / 10</h4>

<p>A wonderful beer for drinking on a hot summer day (which we did), this easy to drink beer left me wishing I could have a keg of it every summer.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Wife: 9 / 10

<ul>
<li>I would pay money for this beer; please send me the recipe!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://brewpuppy.github.io/blog/2013/06/15/savor-2013/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://brewpuppy.github.io/blog/2013/06/15/savor-2013</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Held in Washington D.C. for the last five years, <a href="http://www.savorcraftbeer.com/">SAVOR</a> took place this year at the Altman Building and adjoining Metropolitan Pavilion in Manhattan, New York. Attendees enjoy a reception-style sampling of sweet and savoury appetizers and craft beers from over seventy small and independent craft breweries.</p>

<p>If I had to describe my SAVOR experience in one word it would be <em>overwhelming</em>. I say this in the best possible way but I was entirely unprepared for the event. Not that I did not plan ahead (I remembered to wear pants and everything!) and this wasn&rsquo;t the first beer/wine tasting events I had attended. Maybe it was just the product of a Midwesterner&rsquo;s first time in the Big Apple but this event was broad in a scope to a degree I had not imagined.</p>

<p>SAVOR offers the opportunity to participate in directed tasting salons featuring stars from the craft beer and food scene. Very few events offer the opportunity to have a one-on-one conversation with the rock stars of the craft beer world. My frantic Ticketmaster antics during the pre-sale managed to secure myself tickets to one of the salon&rsquo;s:</p>

<p><strong>Apocalypse Now and Again (and Again)</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>If the world were coming to end, what beer would you brew? In 2012, <a href="http://www.elysianbrewing.com">Elysian Brewing Company</a> answered that question with their 12 Beers of the Apocalypse series. While the world may not have come to an end, the Apocalypse series did, leaving behind a dozen unique beers, each brewed with unusual ingredients. Join Elysian founder Dick Cantwell as he shares samples of four beers from the series and talks about the trials and tribulations of the project.</p></blockquote>

<p>Only a small increase in the ticket price, the private tasting was money well spent. If the ticket price weren&rsquo;t so steep I would probably go both days just to have the opportunity to attend two salons. Read on for a look into our SAVOR experience.</p>

<p>By the time we arrived to the event, the line had wrapped around the Altman Building twice. Some store owners were not pleased about us being there as we were so they erected a &ldquo;sturdy barricade&rdquo; to keep the unruly beer enthusiasts in check. During our wait I almost got a picture of Sam Calagione walking by but wasn&rsquo;t fast enough on the draw with the camera.</p>

<p>Each brewery had two beers for tasting, each paired with a small food dish. These dishes were not quite unique to each brewery so we started having repeats near the end of the night. However, the beers kept changing so we we&rsquo;re too concerned (that&rsquo;s why we were there after all) and any food was appreciated after missing dinner.</p>

<p>Not all beer servers at the event were on the same playing field. Some were just hired help, there to serve the beer with no real knowledge of the beer or the brewery employing them. On the other hand, some servers intimately knew the beers they were serving and, more importantly, were passionate about them. There people were a real joy to talk to about the beers we were tasting and made the encounter with that brewery extra special.</p>

<p>If I had to choose one beer which stood out about the rest it was Biere de Tartine by Linden Street Brewery. Fermented with a trained sourdough yeast, this beer had a definitive bread taste and the result was amazing.</p>

<p>The highlight of the event for me was the tasting salon <em>Apocalypse Now and Again (and Again)</em>. The experience was a wonderfully intimate telling of Dick Cantwell&rsquo;s journey through Elysian Brewing&rsquo;s Twelve Beers of the Apocalypse project and what it means to use speciality ingredients on a commercial level. We were able to taste a few of the beer from that project with added commentary from the brewer. I can still taste the chocolate chili beer as I write this. Rather than attempt to summarize the experience in a watered-down paragraph, I recommend you instead listen to the <a href="http://www.craftbeerradio.com/cbr-savor/SAVOR.2013.061513.ApocalypseNowAgainAgain.mp3">actual thing</a>. Bonus: At the 48 minute 13 second mark, I&rsquo;m the one who &ldquo;stumps&rdquo; Dick Cantwell with a question.</p>

<p>Three hours had gone by before we knew it and sadly it was time to leave. On the way each person received a bottle of the New York Limited collaboration beer from Brooklyn, Ommegang and Saranac. I&rsquo;ll post tasting notes after I get back and settled in.</p>

<p>Things to be aware of at future events:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make Time for Dinner &ndash; There was construction on our direct subway line so we didn&rsquo;t have time to eat dinner. Even though the beer had food pairings, not eating was rough, especially toward the end of the night.</li>
<li>Have a Game Plan &ndash; Even if you do not attend a Salon, there is no way to taste all of the beers available in only three hours. Look over the list of attending breweries beforehand and prioritize which ones you would like to see. Be aware there can be a line at some of the sponsoring breweries.</li>
</ul>
