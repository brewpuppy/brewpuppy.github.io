Elbow recommended a rare variety of chocolate from the Dominican Republic, prized for its robust flavor and aroma. More than a mere flavoring, the crushed, roasted beans were incorporated into the brewing process itself.</p>

<p>Chocolate Ale is full of surprises, beginning with a glowing amber hue. The aroma is given over to earthy, fruity cocoa, with just a hint of hops. Smooth layers of dark chocolate intertwine with threads of caramel, vanilla, and nutty malt as the flavor warms and rounds to a bitter-sweet finish.</p>

<h3>What I Expected</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style23.php">Speciality Beer (23)</a>, base style unknown but my guess is a <a href="http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style10.php#1c">American Brown Ale (10C)</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Appearance &ndash; Clear, dark amber color. Moderate, light tan head with decent retention from the wheat.</li>
<li>Aroma &ndash; Fruit notes mixed with a rich cocoa, with just a hint of green/minty hop aroma. The character of the cacao nibs should be evident.</li>
<li>Flavor &ndash; High caramel, vanilla, and nutty malt flavors. Medium bitter finish from the chocolate. Slightly sweet from the caramel malts. Medium body finishing with some alcohol warmth. The distinctive flavor character associated from the cacao nibs should be noticeable.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Tasting Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Appearance &ndash; Copper color with medium-high clarity. The head is an ivory with low retention, possibly from being on draft. The CO2 bubbles rising from the sides of the glass from the higher level makes the beer quite the looker.</li>
<li>Aroma &ndash; Exactly how a chocolate ale should smell. The cocoa is the dominant aroma with sweet caramel malt coming in a distant second. Possibly some fruit mixed in there but the cocoa has beaten the other aromas into submission.</li>
<li>Flavor &ndash; Heavy malt, with grainy, caramel, and cocoa dominating. Reminds me of the flavors of a Tootsie Roll but with a rich vanilla backbone. The cacao gives the beer a different sort of bitterness which doesn&rsquo;t linger.</li>
<li>Mouthfeel &ndash; Dry finish which evaporates off the tongue. Light bodied and effervescent with lingering alcohol warmth.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Conclusion: Excellent (43 / 50)</h3>

<p><strong>Guest Tasters:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The Wife: Outstanding (47 / 50)</li>
</ul>


<h4>Appearance: 2 / 3</h4>

<p>The practically non-existent head cost the beer one point.</p>

<ul>
<li>Second Opinion &ndash; The Wife: 2 / 3

<ul>
<li>Head: Low Size and Retention, Cream Color</li>
<li>Medium Clarity</li>
<li>Amber/Brown Color</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Aroma: 8 / 12</h4>

<p>I did not experience any earthy or hop aromas which were not overpowered by the cacao. There was perhaps a touch of fruitiness, but I could have been making that up in my head it was so slight. While I quite enjoyed the aroma, I had to dock the beer for not being as described.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Wife: 11 / 12

<ul>
<li>High Sweetness</li>
<li>Caramel malt</li>
<li>Chocolate Cherries</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Flavor: 19 / 20</h4>

<p>I was sceptical of how the dominating cocoa would work out, but the taste is almost exactly what I expected.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Wife: 19 / 20

<ul>
<li>Medium-High Caramel Malt</li>
<li>Medium-High Sweetness, Medium-Low Bitterness</li>
<li>Medium Earthy Hops</li>
<li>Even Balance</li>
<li>Berry and Chocolate flavors (chocolate covered cherries)</li>
<li>Just enough bitterness to cut the sweetness at the end</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Mouthfeel: 5 / 5</h4>

<p>The light body prevents the beer from feeling too heavy from the sweetness and chocolate flavors.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Wife: 5 / 5

<ul>
<li>Medium-High Body</li>
<li>Medium Carbonation</li>
<li>Low-Medium Warmth and Creaminess</li>
<li>Dry Finish</li>
<li>Smooth with slight tingle on the back end with the hop flavor</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Overall Impression: 9 / 10</h4>

<p>Chocolate is usually associated with sweet, which this beer is not. As someone who likes drier beers, this beer makes for the perfect dessert pour. I really want to try making ice cream with this beer.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Wife: 10 / 10

<ul>
<li>I would pay money for this beer; please send me the recipe!</li>
<li>Yes please, chocolate dessert.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/2014/01/rye-on-rye/outside.jpg" width="300" title="&ldquo;Outside Facing North&rdquo; &ldquo;Picture of bottle and beer in glass outside with northern light&rdquo;" > Rye is an assertively flavorful grain more often associated with whiskey than with ales but has largely been eclipsed by corn and barley, the sources of bourbon and scotch. When Boulevard procured seasoned barrels from <a href="http://www.templetonrye.com">Templeton Rye</a>, they chose to brew a rich, tawny rye ale, then mellowed it in the warmth of charred oak rye whiskey casks. Two kinds of malted rye provide spicy sweetness, giving way to notes of caramelized wood and the citrusy tang of Citra and Ahtanum hops before easing into a dry, lingering finish.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>Heads up!</strong> Despite what your bottle label may say, Boulevard Brewer Jeremy Danner has confirmed the hop schedule listed here is correct.</div>

<h3>What I Expected</h3>

<p>What first springs to mind for me is an imperial version of an <a href="http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style06.php#1d">American Rye Beer (6D)</a> but the color is far too dark to be true to the style, not to mention the oak aging. The extra bitterness should balance out the rich malts as long as the spice of the rye is not overpowering.</p>

<ul>
<li>Appearance &ndash; Dark amber more in line with a porter or stout and a nice solid head from the rye.</li>
<li>Aroma &ndash; Oak, caramels, and maybe a touch of citrus or spicy notes.</li>
<li>Flavor &ndash; Sweet caramels from the crystal malts and spiciness from the rye on the front. Warmth from the alcohol. Rich sweetness from the high OG balanced with the bitterness of the hops and rye. I&rsquo;m not sure how the citrus flavors of the hops will fit in but I&rsquo;m hoping they compliment the spiciness of the rye. Oak flavors always take me by surprise in their individual character so while I&rsquo;m expecting the oak flavors to be noticeable, I&rsquo;m not sure exactly how it will come through.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Tasting Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Appearance &ndash; Beautiful amber, mostly clear with just a touch of turbidity. Average dark beige head which dissipates quickly.</li>
<li>Aroma &ndash; Caramel and dark fruit notes with some rye spiciness pulling everything together. Brett sourness comes to mind, possibly from the combination of hops and barrel character.</li>
<li>Flavor &ndash; Simple elegant flavors of rich caramel and a sourness/citrus of hops which I found extremely similar to Brett. Rye was mellow but in a good way. Pleasant warmth of alcohol complements the sweet bourbon twang from the barrels.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Conclusion: Excellent (44 / 50)</h3>

<p><strong>Guest Tasters:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The Wife: Excellent (44 / 50)</li>
</ul>


<h4>Appearance: 2 / 3</h4>

<p>The low head retention cost the beer one point, but was otherwise spot on.</p>

<ul>
<li>Second Opinion &ndash; The Wife: 3 / 3

<ul>
<li>Head: Smooth Texture, Medium Size, Medium-Low Retention, Cream Color</li>
<li>Low Clarity</li>
<li>Amber/Brown Color</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Aroma: 10 / 12</h4>

<p>The caramels and rye spiciness were present, but the sour notes while pleasant, were definitely unexpected.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Wife: 10 / 12

<ul>
<li>High levels of Rich, Caramel, Roasty malt</li>
<li>Medium-Low Hops</li>
<li>Medium-High Sweetness</li>
<li>Slight Brett Smell</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Flavor: 19 / 20</h4>

<p>The complimentary flavors from the malts and the oak tie everything together. Even the citrus sourness which I was so sceptical about fit perfectly into the overall experience.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Wife: 18 / 20

<ul>
<li>Medium-High Hops</li>
<li>Citrusy Hops similar to the tang of Brett</li>
<li>Medium-High Rich, Caramel Malt</li>
<li>Even Balance</li>
<li>Twang of brett or citrus hops</li>
<li>Sweet tingle at the front which mellows with a slight bittering of oak flavor at the end</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Mouthfeel: 4 / 5</h4>

<p>A bit more carbonation than I would prefer in this style; rough on the mouth. However, I let mine breathe for a few minutes and by then it was perfect.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Wife: 4 / 5

<ul>
<li>Sweet Finish</li>
<li>Nice elevated amount of carbonation</li>
<li>Sweet beginning with smooth finish leaves mouth clean</li>
<li>Citrus tingling flavor once the drink is done</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Overall Impression: 9 / 10</h4>

<p>For a &ldquo;harsher&rdquo; rye beer, this is quite drinkable. The balance is spot on for what I enjoy drinking. The oak flavors, especially the bourbon, are great as the beer gets closer to 50F. However, I do not recommend drinking the beer about 55F because the balance goes totally off the wall.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Wife: 9 / 10

<ul>
<li>I would pay money for this beer; please send me the recipe!</li>
</ul>

    <id>http://brewpuppy.github.io/blog/2013/09/08/boulevard-sierra-nevada-terra-incognita</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/2013/09/terra-incognita/outside.jpg" width="300" title="&ldquo;Outside Facing North&rdquo; &ldquo;Picture of bottle and beer in glass outside with northern light&rdquo;" > First brewed in 2012 for SAVOR attendees, <a href="http://terraincognitabeer.com/">Terra Incognita</a> is a collaboration between the Sierra Nevada and Boulevard breweries which was released commercially in 2013. Terra Incognita is a blend of three different aging processes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Terra Incognita aged in Templeton Rye barrels (30%)</li>
<li>Terra Incognita aged in a 2,000-gallon foudre (45%)</li>
<li>Fresh Terra Incognita dry-hopped with East Kent Golding (25%)</li>
</ul>


<p>This blending creates a beer aimed at showcasing some predominant oak characteristics with a subtle hint of earthy hops and which celebrates the unique terroir of the two brewery locations. Then just prior to bottling a dose of the wild yeast Brettanomyces is added and the beer is aged for over three months.</p>

<ul>
<li>Color &ndash; 92.5 EBC / 47 SRM</li>
<li>Bitterness &ndash; 38.5 IBU</li>
<li>Original Gravity &ndash; 16.9 Plato / 1.069 Specific Gravity</li>
<li>Terminal Gravity &ndash; 2.10 (after BC) Plato / 1.008 Specific Gravity</li>
<li>Alcohol (ABV) &ndash; 8.5%</li>
<li>CO2 &ndash; Bottles &ndash; 6 g/L</li>
</ul>


<!-- More -->


<h3>What I Expected</h3>

<p>I did not have much to work with so this is nothing but guesswork. The vital statistics match that of a stout (category 13) with the ABV making my best approximation as an imperial stout.</p>

<ul>
<li>Appearance &ndash; Dark in color, almost black with a rich head to match.</li>
<li>Aroma &ndash; Mild earthy hop flavors mixed with some oak notes from the barrel aging.</li>
<li>Flavor &ndash; Earthy and spicy flavors from the hops with an rich oak back-end balanced by the warmth of the alcohol. Because the Brettanomyces is added late in the process I don&rsquo;t expect it to be a dominant flavor but rather something subtle in the background.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Tasting Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Appearance &ndash; Huge tan colored head which was rock-solid and seemed to last <em>forever</em>. Beer was deep copper with good clarity.</li>
<li>Aroma &ndash; Strong earthy hop aroma with a touch of rye spiciness and lactic sourness.</li>
<li>Flavor &ndash; The rye and oak flavors blend well on the front of the taste. Some sweetness balanced with a dry bittering on the finish.</li>
<li>Mouthfeel &ndash; Medium carbonation despite the huge head (which annoying kept getting on my nose). Dry finish.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Conclusion: Very Good (33 / 50)</h3>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/2013/09/terra-incognita/outside-closeup.jpg" width="350" title="&ldquo;Outside Facing North&rdquo; &ldquo;Picture of bottle and beer in glass outside with northern light&rdquo;" ></p>

<p><strong>Guest Tasters:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The Wife: Excellent (37 / 50)</li>
</ul>


<h4>Appearance: 3 / 3</h4>

<p>The color and head of this beer was exactly what I expected which deserves a perfect score.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Wife: 2 / 3

<ul>
<li>Head: High Size, High Retention, Frothy Texture, Tan Color</li>
<li>Brown/Black color</li>
<li>Lace</li>
<li>Too much head</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Aroma: 10 / 12</h4>

<p>While the hops flavors were present in the aroma I was missing the oak notes.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Wife: 10 / 12

<ul>
<li>Caramel, Roasty, Medium-High Malt</li>
<li>Earthy, Medium Hops</li>
<li>Low-Medium Sweetness</li>
<li>Bittersweet oak background smell</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Flavor: 10 / 20</h4>

<p>Why is the hop gone? Strangely, despite the bold hop aroma little to none of the earthy hop flavors which dominated the aroma remain.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Wife: 17 / 20

<ul>
<li>Rich, Toasty, Roasty, Medium Malt</li>
<li>Earthy, Spicy, Medium Hops</li>
<li>Low Sweetness</li>
<li>Low Acidic Back-end</li>
<li>Even Balance</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Mouthfeel: 4 / 5</h4>

<p>Unfortunately, the Hulk Hogan head got in the way of drinking this beer.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Wife: 5 / 5

<ul>
<li>Medium-High Body</li>
<li>Medium Carbonation</li>
<li>Medium Warmth</li>
<li>Low Creaminess</li>
<li>Medium, Dry Finish</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Overall Impression: 6 / 10</h4>

<p>This beer would be nice to have once in a while but not on a regular basis. I would be more willing to drink one on a crisp Autumn day as opposed to a hot Summer afternoon. Even then I would probably only drink one glass.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Wife: 3 / 10

<ul>
<li>High Stylistic Accuracy</li>
<li>High Technical Merit</li>
<li>Low Intangibles</li>
<li>I would finish this sample</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
