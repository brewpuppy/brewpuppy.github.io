    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Raccoon River Brewery is located in downtown Des Moines, a bit difficult to find but that could have been the snow and just generally not knowing where I was in a new city. We also have a hard time not calling it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon_City">Raccoon City</a> Brewery which made for some interesting conversations.</p>

<p>A large upscale restaurant with a pub feel, Raccoon River has a second level which looks down onto the first. A two-story tower of brewing equipment becomes a centerpiece for both levels of the restaurant. The top level looks down on the bottom and has pool tables. We didn&rsquo;t see much else because we never went up. Next time I&rsquo;m make sure to get a real tour.</p>

<h2>Beers</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/2013/02/raccoon-river-brewing-company/full-glasses.jpg" width="350"></p>

<h3>Tallgrass Light</h3>

<p><em><small>High-quality, lightest</small></em></p>

<p>Clear enough to see The Wife&rsquo;s face through. Light malty nose and what you&rsquo;d expect from a standard pilsner.</p>

<h3>Homestead Red</h3>

<p><em><small>A classic Red, rich and malty</small></em></p>

<p>Beautiful red color with a definite caramel nose and tastes of raisins. The bitterness was higher than I expected but balanced out nicely with the caramel malts.</p>

<h3>Bandit IPA</h3>

<p><em><small>Most assertive, highly hopped</small></em></p>

<p>Gold in color and full of hoppy aromatics. The bitterness is early and often which pairs well with the citrus hops used. This is not a beer I could drink all evening, but I would definitely have at least one before moving on to something else.</p>

<h3>Fatal Attraction (Seasonal)</h3>

<p><em><small>Strong golden Belgian ale, high gravity</small></em></p>

<p>Cloudy appearance with a sweet, crisp nose. The malty sweetness and the fruity esters of the yeast combine with effervescence mouth-feel which tingles on the tongue to make this beer quite the experience.</p>

<h3>MacCoy&rsquo;s Scotch Ale</h3>

<p>*<small>Sweet, malty and complex dark ale, high gravity</small></p>

<p>Dark red in color, this beer has a dark, sweet raisin/chocolate taste which comes through in the nose. Caramel malts provided a balanced sweetness.</p>

<h3>Stonecutter Stout</h3>

<p><em><small>Big, dark and complex oatmeal stout</small></em></p>

<p>Black in color with a beautiful rich coffee nose (I want an air freshener that duplicates this smell). Light in body, this beer has a dark roasted front and a light bitter back.</p>

<h3>Stonecutter Imperial Stout</h3>

<p><em><small>Stonecutter Stout, times two</small></em></p>

<p>More subtle nose than the regular Stonecutter Stout. The extra alcohol overpowers other flavors which ruins the warming mouth-feel.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
Two beers stood out from the others so much we could not decide which one we liked more so we just gave them both first place on our lists.
</div>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The Wife and I both had burgers with sauteed vegetables. While the burgers were unique, they did not leave enough of an impression to remember what we had by the time we were home. I do remember they were good when we ate them though, so I wouldn&rsquo;t shy away from eating there in the future.</p>

<p>I may not be excited to eat here, but I will be excited about trying their beer and there are some excellent ones at Raccoon River. What is on tap changes regularly enough to always provide something new during your visit.</p>

<p>I will warn you if you visit in the early afternoon on a weekday, you may end up with a older waitress with a gruff demeanor. Do not be discouraged. If you can look past that and make conversation about the beer, she&rsquo;ll warm up to you.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/2013/02/olde-main-brewing-company/sign.jpg" width="300"> Old Maine Brewery is located in the heart of downtown Ames' quaint Main Street district. Enter the restaurant and brewpub and you are immediately drawn in by the historic Main Street atmosphere and friendly brewpub feel. An abundance of wood gives the interior a warm, old-fashioned feeling making you right at home.</p>

<p>We ordered a plate of cheese fries at the time of the beer tasting so we would be able to continue driving afterwards. The cheese fries were about what you would expect at a bowling alley and easily something I could have made at home (frozen French fries + American cheese). Our waitress was very nice and quite helpful even though she was obviously busy preparing for the evening crowd. For this reason we forgive her for suggesting the cheese fries appetizer.</p>

<h3>Address</h3>

<p><strong>Olde Main Brewing Company &amp; Restaurant</strong><br>
316 Main Street<br>
Ames, Iowa 50010<br>
<a href="http://www.oldemainbrewing.com/">www.oldemainbrewing.com</a></p>

<h2>Beers</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/2013/02/olde-main-brewing-company/full-glasses.jpg" width="350"></p>

<h3>Long Face</h3>

<p><em><small>Amber Ale. A horse walks into a bar and the bartender says, &ldquo;Why the long face?&rdquo; An all around easy drinking, tasty beverage with malt and notable caramel flavors balanced by several American hop varieties.</small></em></p>

<p>Light malt flavor, less than what I expected out of an Amber Ale. Nice gold color. Pronounced bitterness which does not linger. Feels more like a German Pilsner than an Amber Ale.</p>

<h3>Off KILTer</h3>

<p><em><small>Scottish Ale. This traditional Scottish Ale has a subdued hop flavor and aroma with a high in malt flavor. Our brew master actually wears a kilt while brewing this ale to achieve maximum Scottish feel and tradition.</small></em></p>

<p>Amber in color with a noticeable malt aroma. Syrupy flavors almost conceal the peat which would have worked had it not been so out of balance.</p>

<h3>Clone</h3>

<p><em><small>American Pale Ale. Simply a &ldquo;Clone&rdquo; of an American classic, this American Pale Ale is crisp and clean with a noteworthy hoppy bite. The subtle malt background balances out the refreshing ale.</small></em></p>

<p>Light nose with a very pale yellow color; could easily pass as a pilsner. Moderate citrus hops balanced with bitterness. The dry finish is good for slow drinking during lasting conversations.</p>

<h3>Dinkey Wheat</h3>

<p><em><small>Belgian Style Wheat Ale. Named for the train that used to run from downtown Ames to the ISU Campus, the Dinkey Wheat has a flavor derived from coriander, chamomile, and orange peel, making for a unique drinking experience.</small></em></p>

<p>The aroma of this beer reminded me of a bag of chamomile tea before being brewed. Unfortunately, the beer tasted like someone steeped a bag of chamomile tea in an unfiltered wheat; not a good flavor.</p>

<h3>Sodbuster</h3>

<p><em><small>Stout Ale. Hearty ale with color and flavors derived from roast, chocolate, and caramel malts. This ale has a complex taste with a rich creamy mouth-feel. The pronounced hop presence balances the deep malt flavors.</small></em></p>

<p>Distinct aroma of roasted coffee. Light body with a drying finish. Dark roasted malts gives this beer a taste perfectly in tune with its aroma.</p>

<h3>Gryphonbrau</h3>

<p><em><small>Premium Lager. Germans brought lager beer to America in the 19th century. They brewed those early American lagers using a combination of local and traditional ingredients. In keeping with tradition we do the same. Local water and malted barley combine with traditional German hops and yeast means that Gryph is made the way that American lagers always should have been, with zero compromise on quality. It&rsquo;s an easy drinker with a slight malt sweetness and light hop flavor and aroma. This refreshing beer has a crisp and clean finish.</small></em></p>

<p>Clear and quite pale straw color. Floral nose and a slightly fruity taste but without esters. The light matliness brought the hops to the forefront of this beer. While too much for what I expect in a light lager, the taste intrigues me and makes me wish they had listed what hops where used.</p>

<h3>Elkman</h3>

<p><em><small>Milk Stout. The sweet character in this beer comes from lactose sugar added into the kettle and residual sugars left over after fermentation is complete.  Roasted grains with chocolate, caramel, and coffee flavors are the flagship tastes with the sweetness uniting these flavors together to give a full-bodied, creamy ale with a smooth finish.  This is a dark, deep, black colored ale with thick brown foam.</small></em></p>

<p>Creamy nose and a beautiful clear dark red color. Light body with a creamy mouth-feel.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Olde Maine is very generous with their beer sampler. We received eight 4 oz pours for a measly $6.00. This is a great deal for someone who needs a break from I-35 and worth the short detour. There are few places which can match the number of beers for the price.</p>

<p>For the most part I could tell where the brewer was headed with beer and there are some good beers hiding here. However, I do not think the recipes were quite finished and definitely need some tweaking. Balancing the flavors is all this brewery needs to become a great brewpub, instead of just an alright restaurant bar with hit-or-miss beers.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/2013/02/court-avenue-brewing-company/pub-sign.jpg" width="300"> I had originally planned on my first stop through Des Moines to be the Raccoon River brewery, however we wandered the downtown streets without a map and eventually became lost. Luckily, we ended up going in the direction of the Court Avenue brewery which had a conveniently large sign to direct you out of the cold and into a warm restaurant. Fate had spoken, so we switched our agenda and made Court Avenue our first brewery stop of the trip.</p>

<p>I ordered the BBQ Pork sandwich which was shredded pork in BlackHawk Stout BBQ sauce on Texas toast and topped with coleslaw and a side of potato salad. The Wife ordered the BBQ Chicken pizza which has grilled chicken, red onion, fresh cilantro &amp; BlackHawk Stout BBQ sauce, with cheddar jack &amp; mozzarella cheese. For dessert we shared a huge piece of bread pudding. Needless to say we were stuffed by the end of the meal. All-in-all the food was absolutely amazing; the pictures cannot do them justice (especially with our old camera). In fact, I may have enjoyed the food more than the beer (gasp!).</p>

<p>A good portion of the brewing equipment (kettles, fermenters, etc.) are behind glass in the dining room which makes for an interesting centerpiece during the dining experience. These are not only for show either, because we watched a brewer actively brewing something during our visit. He even stopped by our table and asked us how we were enjoying the beer when he saw me taking notes.</p>

<p>I was able to try most of the flagship beers as well as a few guest beers from <a href="http://21st-amendment.com/">21st Amendment</a>, a seasonal, and the special reserve stock in their standard sampler flight. My thoughts on the flagship beers below.</p>

<h3>Address</h3>

<p><strong>Court Avenue Brewing Co</strong><br>
309 Court Avenue<br>
Des Moines, Iowa, 50309<br>
<a href="http://www.courtavebrew.com/">www.courtavebrew.com</a></p>

<li>Happy Hour Prices &ndash; Anytime</li>
<li>VIP tour with Brewer</li>
</ul>


<h2>Beers</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/2013/02/court-avenue-brewing-company/full-glasses.jpg" width="350"></p>

<h3>Two Rivers Light</h3>

<p><em><small>Our Two Rivers Light is the lightest brew we produce and is a great introduction to craft beer or alternative for the person who enjoys macro lagers.</small></em></p>

<p>Standard pilsner with a nice malt flavor. Reminds me of by favorite local pilsner, Boulevard Pilsner but less crisp. Court Avenue uses this beer as a gateway beer into the craft beer world.</p>

<h3>Belgian White</h3>

<p><em><small>An old Belgian farmhouse style, our white (or wit) is a wheat beer brewed with coriander and Curacao orange peel. A distinctive yeast strain, coupled with these spices, produces a cloudy, almost white beer, that&rsquo;s fruity, spicy and exceptionally refreshing.</small></em></p>

<p>Nice fruity nose. Spot on stylistically and exactly what I expect of a Belgian White. Dry clean finish but with a lingering coriander/citrus afternotes.</p>

<h3>Pointer Brown Ale</h3>

<p><em><small>Southern English style of brown ale. Caramel, chocolate, slightly roasty flavors dominate the profile of this beer. Brewed to be flavorful and highly drinkable at the same time.</small></em></p>

<p>Light caramel nose with raisin notes. Nice balance between sweetness and bitterness. While I enjoyed the beer, it was not what I was expect from a Brown Ale.</p>

<h3>BlackHawk Stout</h3>

<p><em><small>A dry oatmeal stout. Coffee, roast and chocolate flavors throughout, very smooth body from the addition of flaked oats. The use of six different malts makes this a very complex beer.</small></em></p>

<p>Reminds me of a creamy, fuller-bodied Guinness. Perfect for nursing through a late evening with a gathering of friends. The Wife said it reminds her of a smoother, lighter bodies Oatmeal Stout from <a href="http://www.freestatebrewing.com/">Free State Brewery</a>.</p>

<h3>Least Favorite</h3>

<li>Peach Tree IPA</li>
<li>The Wife: Peach Tree IPA</li>
</ul>


<p>In all fairness, the <a href="http://www.peacetreebrewing.com/">Peach Tree</a> IPA was not brewed at Court Avenue and was a stand-in for their Honest Lawyer IPA of which they had ran out (curses!). This beer was earthy on the hops and, in our opinion, had too much bitterness to balance out making this our least favorite beer.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The available beers provided a wide range of tastes so everyone in your party should find something they can enjoy. For example, I overheard a couple sitting at a table next to us say <em>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like beer, but this is good!&rdquo;</em> about the Two Rivers Light. While the beer was good, I have to admit the food was amazing and stole the show during our visit. I may venture to say Court Avenue has the best food of any restaurant-brewery I have ever visited. I would recommend Court Avenue to anyone passing through Des Moines; the brewery has obtained a permanent spot on our &ldquo;To Visit&rdquo; list.</p>
